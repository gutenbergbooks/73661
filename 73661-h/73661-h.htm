  <h2 class='c008'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Pious Soul</span>:</p>
<p class='c009'>The Spiritual Father who presents
himself to you under this title is the
gentle Bishop of Geneva, who, in the
opinion of St. Jane Chantal and St.
Vincent de Paul, was the most perfect
imitation of our Saviour living
among men.</p>
<p class='c007'>Love for souls is his great passion.
He is not astonished at either falls
or discouragement, which he cures
by remedies as gentle as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>efficacious. Whatever your disposition
you will find sometimes a word
of consolation, sometimes a counsel
of perfection, or a means of accomplishing
a difficult step in the ways
of God, and of elevating yourself to
Him.</p>

<p class='c010'>This collection is like the inner
life of the Saint unconsciously written
by himself. He first practised,
and then taught. One is gentle
from motives of virtue, only when he
possesses moral strength; now we
find in these lines the secret of that
strength which made St. Francis de
Sales the gentlest of men. He admirably
inculcates the method of
sanctity which he perfectly possessed—a
sanctity which seems so
easy to realise that we feel a desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>to reproduce it. It is the flower
which the Spiritual Father causes to
bloom in your soul. It will soon
bear fruit if you are faithful.</p>

<p class='c010'><i>These counsels have been carefully
gleaned from the complete collection of
the holy Doctor.</i></p>

FRANCIS DE SALES</b></i></span><br> <br><span class='sc'>For Every Day of the Year</span>.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>1.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Keep yourself faithfully in the presence
of God; avoid hurry and
anxiety, for there are no greater obstacles
to our progress in perfection.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>2.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Cast your heart gently, not violently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>into the wounds of our Saviour;
have an unlimited confidence
in his mercy and goodness.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>3.</h3>

<p class='c009'>To make good progress we must
devote ourselves to getting over that
portion of the path which lies close
before us, and not amuse ourselves
with the desire to attain the last step
before we have accomplished the
first.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>4.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must make our imperfections
die with us from day to day. Dear
imperfections, which cause us to recognise
our misery, which exercise us
in contempt of self, and the practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>of virtue, and notwithstanding which
God accepts the preparation of our
hearts which is perfect.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>5.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I recommend simplicity to you;
look before you, and not at the dangers
which you behold in the distance.
Keep your will firmly bent
upon serving God with your whole
heart. While you are thus occupied
in forecasting the future you expose
yourself to some false step.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>6.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Have no care for the morrow;
think only of doing well to-day, and
when to-morrow shall have become
to-day then we shall think about it.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>7.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>We must make a provision of
manna for each day only; and let us
not be afraid that God will fail to
send down more upon us to-morrow
and the day after to-morrow, and
every day of our pilgrimage.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>8.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Since the Heart of our Lord has
no more loving law than meekness,
humility, and charity we must firmly
maintain these dear virtues in us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>9.</h3>

<p class='c009'>True sanctity lies in love of God,
and not in foolish imaginings, raptures,
&#38;c. Let us devote ourselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>to the practice of true meekness and
submission, to renouncement of self,
to docility of heart, to love of abjection,
to consideration for the wishes
of others: this is true sanctity and
the most amiable ecstasy of the
children of God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>10.</h3>

<p class='c009'>May you belong to God for ever in
this mortal life, serving Him faithfully
through its trials, bearing the
cross after Him, and may you be his
for ever in life eternal with the whole
celestial court!</p>
<h3 class='c011'>11.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The great good of our souls is to
live for God, and the greatest good
to live for God alone.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>12.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He who lives but for God is never
sad, save at having offended God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>13.</h3>

<p class='c009'>He who lives but for God seeks
only God, and since God is with him
in adversity as well as in prosperity,
he dwells in peace in the midst of
tribulation.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>14.</h3>

<p class='c009'>He who lives but for God frequently
thinks of Him during all the
occupations of life.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>15.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Then let us belong wholly to Him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and live but for Him, desiring only
to please Him, and for his creatures
in Him, through Him, and for Him.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>16.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Make your little efforts sweetly,
peacefully, and amiably to please
this Sovereign Goodness, and do not
be astonished at difficulties.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>17.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must be constant in aspiring
to the perfection of holy love, in
order that love may be perfect; for
the love which seeks anything less
than perfection cannot fail to be imperfect.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>18.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Never permit your soul to be sad
and live in bitterness of spirit or
scrupulous fear, since He who loved
it and died to give it life is so good,
so sweet, so amiable.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>19.</h3>

<p class='c009'>To live contentedly in our exile,
we must keep before our eyes the
hope of our arrival in the country
where we shall live for ever.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>20.</h3>

<p class='c009'>God, who calls us to Him, sees
how we are approaching, and will
never permit anything to happen but
what is for our greater good.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>21.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>God knows what we are, and will
hold out his paternal hand to us in
a difficult step, in order that nothing
may arrest us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>22.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Never look forward to the accidents
of life with apprehension; anticipate
them with a perfect hope
that God, whose child you are, will
deliver you from them, according as
they come.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>23.</h3>

<p class='c009'>God has preserved you so far;
only keep yourself faithful to the
law of his providence and He will
assist you at all times, and where
you cannot walk He will carry you.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <h3 id='Maxim24' class='c011'>24.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Do not think of what may happen
to-morrow, for the same eternal
Father who cares for you to-day
will care for you to-morrow and always;
either He will not send you
trouble, or, if He does, He will give
you invincible courage to bear it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>25.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The child can never perish who
remains in the arms of a Father who
is almighty.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>26.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If God does not always give us
what we ask, it is to keep us near
Him and give us an opportunity to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>urge and constrain Him by a loving
violence.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>27.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Behold this great Artisan of mercy.
He converts our miseries into graces
and the poison of our iniquities into
salutary remedies for our souls. Tell
me, I pray, what will He not do
with the afflictions, the labours, the
persecutions which assail us?</p>
<h3 class='c011'>28.</h3>

<p class='c009'>An over-sensitive mind can neither
receive nor endure anything without
telling of it, and it is always a little
astonished at the lowly places which
humility and simplicity choose.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>29.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I see you with your vigorous heart
which loves and wills powerfully. I
like it, for what are those half-dead
hearts good for? We must make a
particular exercise once every week
of willing to love the will of God
more tenderly, more affectionately
than anything in the world, and that,
too, not only in bearable but in the
most unbearable events.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>30.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Even at a time when you had not
so much confidence in God, did you
perish in affliction? Then why have
you not courage to meet all other
trials?</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>31.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Plant in your heart Jesus Christ
Crucified, and all the crosses of this
world will seem to you like roses.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>32.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must not only be willing that
God should strike us, but we must
accept that He shall strike us where
He wills.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>33.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Lord Jesus, without reserve, without
an if, without a but, without exception,
without limitation, may thy
holy will be done in all things, at all
times.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>34.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Daily strengthen yourself more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and more in the resolution, which
you formed with so much affection:
of serving God according to his
good pleasure.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>35.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Never think you have attained the
purity of heart which you owe to
God until your will is freely and
joyfully resigned to his holy will in
all things, even in the most repugnant.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>36.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Regard not the appearance of the
things you are to do, but Him who
commands them, and who, when He
pleases, can accomplish his glory
and our perfection through the most
imperfect and trifling things.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>37.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A true servant of God has no care
for the morrow; he performs faithfully
what is required of him to-day,
and to-morrow he will do what is
required of him without a word.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>38.</h3>

<p class='c009'>So, no matter how God treats you,
it is all the same to you, you tell me....
Ah! how suddenly self-love insinuates
itself into our affections,
however devout they may appear.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>39.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Here is the great lesson: We must
discover God’s will, and, recognising
it, we must endeavour to do it joyfully,
or at least courageously.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>40.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The meek Saviour would have us
meek, so that, though surrounded by
the world and the flesh, we may live
by the Spirit; that, amidst the vanities
of earth, we may live in heaven;
that, living among men, we may
praise Him with the angels.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>41.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The sight alone of our dear Jesus
crucified can speedily soften all sorrows,
which are but flowers compared
with his thorns. And then
our great <i>rendezvous</i> is an eternal
heaven; and compared with the
price of eternity, what are the things
which end with time?</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>42.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Continue to unite yourself more
and more with our Lord. Plunge
your heart into the charity of his,
and say always with your whole
soul: “May I die and may Jesus
live!” Our death will be a happy
one if we have died daily.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>43.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The repugnance you feel testifies
no want of love; for it seems to me
that, if we believed that being flayed
God would love us more we would
flay ourselves, not without repugnance,
but in spite of the repugnance.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>44.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Cultivate not only a solid love, but
a tender, gentle, meek love for those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>about you; I have learned from
experience that infirmities destroy,
not our charity, but our meekness
towards our neighbour, if we are not
strongly on our guard.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>45.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Lord Jesus, what true happiness
for a soul consecrated to God to be
strongly exercised in tribulation before
leaving this life!</p>
<h3 class='c011'>46.</h3>

<p class='c009'>How can we know frank, ardent
love but in the midst of thorns,
crosses, weariness, above all, when
this weariness is prolonged?</p>
<h3 class='c011'>47.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Nothing can give us deeper peace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>in this world than to frequently contemplate
our Lord in all the afflictions
He endured from his birth to
his death: contempt, calumnies, poverty,
abjection, weariness, suffering,
nakedness, wrongs, and grief of every
kind.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>48.</h3>

<p class='c009'>A heart which esteems and grandly
loves Jesus crucified, loves his death,
his sufferings, his insults, his poverty,
his hunger, his thirst; and when
Jesus grants this heart a small
share in them, it is jubilant with
gladness and lovingly embraces
them.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>49.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Every day, not in prayer, but in
your walks, you should recall to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>mind our Lord amid the thorns of
our redemption, and consider what
happiness it would be to share them.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>50.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let us faithfully cultivate that resignation
and pure love of God
which is never wholly practised but
amid sufferings; for to love God,
when He feeds us with sweetness is
nothing more than children do; but
to love Him when He feeds us with
gall is to offer Him the cup of our
loving fidelity.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>51.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I recommend you to God, that you
may obtain the gift of holy patience;
and it is not in my power to propose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>to Him anything for you, save that
He may, according to his holy will,
fashion your heart for his dwelling,
and reign there eternally; and
whether He fashion it with the
brush, the hammer, or the chisel,
must be according to his good pleasure.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>52.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The heart which unites itself to
the Heart of God cannot help loving
and accepting with sweetness the
arrows with which God pierces it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>53.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I desire that your cross and mine
should be wholly the cross of Jesus
Christ; and as to the imposition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>this or that burden, or making any
choice, God knows what He is doing
and why He does it—it is certainly
for our good.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>54.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Our sweet Saviour is pleased that
we should speak to Him of the trouble
He sends us, and that we should
complain, provided it be lovingly
and humbly, and to Himself, just as
little children do when their mother
has punished them.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>55.</h3>

<p class='c009'>God wishes that, like Job, I should
serve Him in the midst of dryness,
suffering, and temptation; like St.
Paul, that I should serve Him according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to his desire. You will see
that one day He will do all and even
more than you can desire.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>56.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I praise God for the constancy
with which you bear tribulations.
Nevertheless I still see in you a little
over-eagerness and restlessness which
form an obstacle to the final effect of
your patience.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>57.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The effect of patience is to possess
one’s soul, and, in proportion to our
patience do we acquire complete and
perfect possession of our soul.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>58.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must lose everything rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>than courage, confidence, and good-will.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>59.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Would to God that we paid little
attention to the condition of the road
which alarms us, but kept our eyes
steadily fixed upon Him who guides
us, and the happy end to which He
leads us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>60.</h3>

<p class='c009'>When you have meditated upon
the grievous anguish which our
Master endured in the Garden, and
in union with Him prayed to the
Father for consolation, if it does not
please Him to send it, think no
more of it, but brace your courage to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>work out your salvation on the
cross, as if you were never to descend
therefrom, and as if you were never
to see the atmosphere of your life
clear and serene.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>61.</h3>

<p class='c009'>For the honour of God yield completely
to his will, and do not think
that you can serve Him better another
way, for we serve Him well
only when we serve Him as He wills.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>62.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We are always wishing for this or
that, and though we have our sweet
Jesus in our breasts, we are not content.
Yet it is all we can desire.
One thing alone is necessary, and
that is, to be near Him.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>63.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Train yourself to serve our Lord
with a strong and fervent gentleness:
it is the true way of serving Him.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>64.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Frequently kiss in your heart the
crosses which our Lord Himself has
placed in your arms. Heed not
whether they are of perfumed or
precious wood: they are more truly
crosses when they are of coarse,
heavy, ordinary wood.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>65.</h3>

<p class='c009'>This sweet love of our hearts casts
us down only to raise us up. He
lurks and hides, peeping through the
lattice, to see the expression of our
countenance.</p>
<div>

  <h3 class='c011'>66.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Keep Jesus closely in your arms,
for it is thus the Spouse holds Him
as a bouquet of myrrh, that is of
bitterness: but He is not bitter; He
only allows us to be bitter to ourselves.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>67.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Being a good servant of God is not
always having consolation and sweetness,
nor being always free from
aversion and repugnance to good.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>68.</h3>

<p class='c009'>To be a good servant of God is
to be charitable to our neighbour,
maintaining in the superior will an
invincible resolution to do God’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>will: to possess great humility and
simplicity in confiding one’s self to
God; to rise as frequently as one
falls; to inure one’s self to humiliations,
and to tranquilly bear with
others and their defects.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>69.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Frequently behold our Lord who
looks down upon you, poor little
creature that you are, and sees you
in the midst of your labours and distractions.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>70.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Frequently raise your heart to
God, ask his help, and let the foundation
of your consolation be the happiness
of belonging to Him.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>71.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let us raise up our hearts, and behold
that of God all goodness, all
love, all love for us! Let us adore
and bless his will in all things, let
Him prune, let Him cut where He
will, for we are eternally his.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>72.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let us place ourselves before our
Crucified Sun, as the weary bee
basks in the rays of the sun, and then
let us say to Him: “O beautiful Sun
of hearts, Thou dost vivify all by the
rays of thy goodness; behold us exhausted
before thee, whence we will
not move, Lord Jesus, until Thy fire
hath revived us!”</p>
<div>

  <h3 class='c011'>73.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Let us not forget the maxim of
the saints, which warns us that every
day we must feel that we begin our
perfection; and if we bear this well
in mind we will not be astonished
at the miseries we find in ourselves.
The work is never done, it must be
always recommenced; and recommenced
with a good heart.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>74.</h3>

<p class='c009'>What we are about to commence
will be better than what we have
done, and when we shall have accomplished
that, we will recommence
something else which shall be still
better, and then something else, until
we leave this world to begin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>another life, which will have no end,
for nothing, nothing better can come
to us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>75.</h3>

<p class='c009'>See, then, whether one should
weep when he finds trouble in his
soul, and whether he ought not
courageously to push on ever further,
since he must never pause, and
whether he ought not to have the resolution
to prune, since we must use
the knife, even to the division of soul
and mind.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>76.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Why do you weep, O woman? No,
you must no longer be a woman,
you must have the heart of a man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>But courage! take heart! we have
our sweet Jesus with us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>77.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The love of God does not consist
in consolations, otherwise our Lord
would not have loved his Father
when He was sorrowful unto death,
and when He cried, “My God, my
God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”
This was the greatest act of love
which it is possible to imagine.</p>
<h3 id='Maxim78' class='c011'>78.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Our imperfections should not
please us, but they should not take
away our courage. God does not
like our imperfections and venial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>sins, but He loves us in spite of
them.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>79.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Live joyfully; our Lord looks
down upon you, and looks upon you
with love, and with a tenderness
proportioned to your foolishness.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>80.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Turn your eyes from yourself, and
direct them towards God with an
humble courage to speak to Him of
his ineffable goodness in loving our
poor human nature, in spite of its
infirmities.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>81.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Our enemy is a great bawler; be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in no way troubled about him, for
he cannot hurt you; despise him,
and pay no attention to him. He
made as much noise and thundered
as loudly about the saints; but behold!
they are lodged in the place
which the miserable creature lost.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>82.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Fear not; you are walking upon
the sea, amid the winds and the
waves, but it is with Jesus. If fear
seizes you, cry loudly, “Lord, save
me!” He will stretch forth his
hand to you; clasp it firmly and go
joyfully on.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>83.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Despise, I pray you, all those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>thoughts of vainglory. For they
are really but flies which cannot
harm but only annoy you. It is an
incompatible thing to be in this
world and not to feel the movements
of the passions.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>84.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let yourself be governed by God;
do not think so much of yourself.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>85.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I expressly forbid you to be over-eager,
as this is the mother imperfection
of all imperfections.</p>
<h3 id='Maxim86' class='c011'>86.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Simplify your judgment. “If your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>eye is simple, your whole body will
be light.” Do not make so many reflections
and replies, but go on with
simplicity and confidence.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>87.</h3>

<p class='c009'>For you there are but God and
yourself in the world, and you should
not concern yourself for all the rest,
save as God commands you.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>88.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Give your soul a thousand times
to God, and sometimes say not a
word to Him, but simply contemplate
his gentleness. This is one
of the great sources of spiritual
gain, for as the mind converses so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>frequently and so easily with its
God it will be perfumed with all
his perfections.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>89.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The Christian soul is the spouse
not yet of Jesus glorified, but of
Jesus crucified; that is why the
rings, ornaments, and tokens with
which He adorns her are crosses,
and thorns, and the nuptial banquet
is gall, hyssop, and vinegar.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>90.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Do not look here and there so
much. Turn your eyes upon God
or yourself; you will never see God
without goodness, or yourself free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>from misery; and you will find his
goodness kind to your misery, and
your misery the object of his mercy.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>91.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Rarely examine closely what
others do; look upon them simply,
kindly, and amiably. Do like the
bees, gather honey from all the
flowers.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>92.</h3>

<p class='c009'>My commandment is, that you do
like little children; while they feel
their mother holding them by the
sleeve, they go on boldly and run about
everywhere, nothing daunted by the
falls that are caused by the weakness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of their legs. Thus, while God
holds you by your good-will to serve
Him, go on boldly, undaunted by
your little stumblings, provided you
cast yourself into his arms and give
Him the kiss of charity.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>93.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Go joyously and with a light heart
as far as you can, and if you cannot
always go joyously, go always
courageously and confidently.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>94.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must have patience, and little
by little, correct and overcome our
bad habits, for life on the whole is a
continual warfare.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>95.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Rest is reserved for heaven; on
earth we must always struggle between
hope and fear, on condition
that hope be ever the stronger when
we consider the almighty power of
Him who helps us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>96.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Frequently during the day cast
your heart, your mind, and your care
upon God with great confidence,
saying, “I am thine, save me.”</p>
<h3 class='c011'>97.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Be kind to your neighbour in
spite of rebellious murmurings and
outbursts of anger.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>98.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Do not be astonished to find yourself
overwhelmed with evil inclinations.
God permits them in order
to make you humble.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>99.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Self-love may be mortified in us,
but it never dies; from time to time
it sends forth shoots which prove
that, though cut down to the root,
it is never completely destroyed.</p>
<h3 id='Maxim100' class='c011'>100.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Self-love never leaves us. It
sleeps sometimes like a fox, then
suddenly springs upon the chickens.
We must therefore be constantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>watchful of it, and patiently defend
ourselves against it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>101.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let us keep firm hold of the merciful
hand of our good God, for He
wishes to draw us after Him.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>102.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Live wholly according to the
Spirit, live quietly in peace, have
perfect confidence that God will help
you.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>103.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Be careful to purify your heart
more and more each day. Now,
this purity consists in weighing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>everything in the scales of the sanctuary,
which are only the will of
God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>104.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let us be what we are, and be
that well, in order that we may
honour the Master Workman who
has made us. Though we were the
most excellent creatures under
heaven, what would it avail us if
we were not pleasing to the will of
God?</p>
<h3 class='c011'>105.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must always and in all things
live peaceably.</p>

<p class='c009'>I approve of your making an act
of humility every day, humbling
yourself to an inferior, performing
some menial office in the house.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>107.</h3>

<p class='c009'>It is not possible that you should
so soon be mistress of your soul, or
that you should control it so absolutely
at first.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>108.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Dispose your soul to tranquillity
in the morning, and be careful
during the day to recall it frequently
to that state, and to keep your soul
within your control.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>109.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Do not be terrified if you are
guilty of some little impatience; do
not let it trouble you, but when you
recognise it quietly humble yourself
before God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>110.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Try to preserve a sweet tranquillity
of mind; say to your soul:
“Courage! we have made a false
step, but let us keep steadily on and
keep watch over ourselves.”</p>
<h3 class='c011'>111.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Be silent concerning all things,

<p class='c009'>Consider for whom you labour,

shall labour in vain.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>114.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Among beggars, those whose sores
are the most terrible consider themselves
the most fortunate, for they
excite more compassion and receive
more abundant alms. We are only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>beggars, and the most miserable
among us are the most fortunate, for
these God looks upon with greater
compassion.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>115.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Be glad that men make no account
of you.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>116.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Consider how all the vexations of
the past have vanished; those of the
future shall vanish in the same way.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>117.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The great point of humility is to
see, to honour, to serve, and converse
fittingly with those whom we dislike,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>keeping ourselves humble, gentle,
and submissive to them, for remember
that the humiliations which are
the least visible are the keenest.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>118.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let our Lord turn us to the left or

but to enter our souls and bless us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>119.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Courage! Let us keep on in the
low valleys of the small and humble
virtues. I love these three little

<h3 class='c011'>120.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I recommend to you more than
anything else the exercise of holy
gentleness and sweetness in all the
events of this life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Accustom yourself in all that you
do to act and speak gently and
quietly, and you will see that in
three or four years you will completely
control that abrupt impulsiveness.</p>

<p class='c009'>He who can preserve peace in the

<p class='c009'>I recommend to you great evenness

more edifying to our neighbour

<h3 class='c011'>124.</h3>

<p class='c009'>When shall we be wholly imbued
with sweetness and gentleness towards
our neighbour? You needed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>only that; your zeal was good, but
it had this fault; it was a little
bitter, over-urgent, and captious.</p>

<p class='c009'>Raise your eyes to heaven, and
among the mortals now immortal

<p class='c009'>Keep your hearts well under control,
beware of over-anxiety. Place
your confidence in the providence of

<p class='c009'>The great secret in prayer is
simply to follow the attractions of
the heart. We must go on in good

reach God, to love Him, and unite
ourselves to Him. True love has

<p class='c009'>You should be so in love with
God that even though you can do
nothing in his presence, you should
nevertheless be glad to be near Him,
were it only to see Him and look at
Him from time to time.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>147.</h3>

<p class='c009'>When your heart is distracted in
prayer, bring it gently back to the
point from which it has wandered,
and lay it tenderly at the feet of its
Master. If you do but this your
hour will be well employed.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>148.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If we can speak to our Lord in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>prayer let us speak to Him, praise

I have often told you that in devotion

acting frankly and promptly. If
you do well, praise God; if ill,
humble yourself.</p>

<p class='c009'>Humble yourself profoundly, and

firmly resolve that you will submit
to all this, and pay no attention to

<p class='c009'>See, my daughter, we are too fastidious
in calling poor a state in
which we endure neither hunger, nor

inconvenience in our plans.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nothing gives us profound tranquillity
in this world but to frequently
look upon our Lord in all
his sufferings. In comparison with
all that He endured, we shall see
that we are wrong to call the little
accidents which we encounter afflictions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and that we do not need patience
for things so trifling, since a
little modesty would suffice to make
us bear well all that happens to us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>169.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must never answer temptations,
nor appear to hear the enemy.
If he is noisy, patience! we must
prostrate ourselves before God and
remain at his feet. He will understand
that we want his assistance,
though we may not be able to speak.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>170.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Believe me, my dear daughter,
sweets engender worms in little children;
that is why our Lord mixes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>bitter with the sweet for us. We must
have a great courage, which on all
occasions will resolutely cry, God be
praised! caring little for sweet or
bitter, light or darkness. Let us
keep on in this essential love.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>171.</h3>

<p class='c009'>God desires that you serve Him
without relish or feeling, in the
midst of aversions and afflictions of
mind. This service will not give
you satisfaction, but it will content
Him; it will not be to your taste
but it will be to his.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>172.</h3>

<p class='c009'>God is so good that He will visit
your soul interiorly, and strengthen

simplicity, and mortification.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>173.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let us always keep on; however
slow our progress we are getting
over a great deal of the road. God

throne of his mercy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Keep your heart brave and ready
for any service that shall be imposed
upon it; according as you undertake
many things for God, He will second
you and work with you.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>175.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Have the heart of a child; a will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>of wax, and a mind free from the
slavery of all affection.</p>
<h3 id='Maxim176' class='c011'>176.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Oh, what a great blessing it is, my
daughter, to be pliable and easily
turned to any service. Our Lord
has taught us this submission by his
example, as much as by his words.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>177.</h3>

<p class='c009'>He who is very attentive to please
the heavenly lover has no leisure for
introspection; his mind continually
tends whither love leads him.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>178.</h3>

<p class='c009'>This exercise of the continual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>abandonment of one’s self to the
hands of God includes in the most
excellent manner all other exercises
in their greatest simplicity, purity,
and perfection, and while God leaves
us the desire for it we should not
change it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>179.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Simplicity is an act of charity
pure and simple, which considers
only God. It looks straight at God,
and can suffer no mixture of self-interest
nor intermingling of creatures;
God alone is its object.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>180.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We should bear tenderly with
those whom our Lord bears with,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>we must bow our heads, and bear
ourselves contrary to our habits and
inclinations.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>181.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Complain as little as possible of
injuries, for it rarely happens that
one complains without sin, since our
self-love exaggerates in our eyes
and hearts the wrongs we have received.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>182.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Hold the cross of our Lord upon
your breast, and as long as you firmly
clasp it in your arms, the enemy will
be at your feet.</p>

  <h3 class='c011'>183.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Great evenness of temper, continual
gentleness and suavity of heart,
are more rare than perfect chastity,
yet very desirable.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>184.</h3>

<p class='c009'>As regards our perfection, which
consists in the union of our soul with
the Divine Goodness, it is only a
question of knowing little and doing
much.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>185.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must make up our minds to
two things: one is, that we shall
find bad weeds growing in our garden,
and the other, that we will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>have the courage to uproot them, for
our self-love will live as long as we
do, and from it arises all this noxious
growth.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>186.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must endeavour to double, not
our desires and our exercises, but
the perfection with which we fulfil
them, seeking by this means to gain
more by one action than we would
by a hundred others done according
to our inclination and affection.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>187.</h3>

<p class='c009'>One act performed in dryness of
spirit is worth more than several
done in great sensible fervour.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>188.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I say, then, that we must die in
order that God may live in us, for it
is impossible to acquire union with
God by any other means than mortification.
These words, “We must
die,” are hard, but they are followed
by a great sweetness, and this sweetness
is union with God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>189.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Your miseries and infirmities
should not astonish you; God has
seen many others, and his mercy
does not reject the miserable, but is
exercised in doing them good.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>190.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must do everything through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>motive of love, and nothing through
compulsion. Our love for obedience
must be greater than our fear of disobedience.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>191.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I leave you liberty of spirit, not
that which excludes obedience, but
that which excludes constraint, scruple,
or over-eagerness.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>192.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Here are the marks of true liberty:
1st. The heart which possesses this
liberty is not attached to consolations,
but receives afflictions with all
the sweetness that the flesh admits
of. I do not say that it does not love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and desire consolations, but that the
heart is not bound to them.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>193.</h3>

<p class='c009'>2nd. Such a heart is in no way attached
to spiritual exercises, so that
if sickness or any other accident
interferes with them it feels no regret.
I also do not say that it does not love
them, but that it is not attached to
them.</p>
<h3 id='Maxim194' class='c011'>194.</h3>

<p class='c009'>3rd. Such a heart rarely loses its
joy, for no privation saddens one
whose heart is not bound to anything.
I do not say that it <i>never</i> loses its
joy, but that it is only for a short
time.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>195.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A soul which possesses true liberty
will leave his prayer, and with an
amiable countenance and gracious
manner greet the importunate person
who disturbs him. For it is the
same to him whether he serve God
in meditation or by bearing with his
neighbour; they are both the will of
God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>196.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Liberty of spirit has two vices: a
spirit of inconstancy and a spirit of
constraint. For example: I resolve
to make a meditation every morning.
If I have a spirit of inconstancy I
will defer it till evening at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>slightest excuse—for the barking of
a dog which has disturbed my sleep,
for a letter to be written, though it
is not at all urgent. On the contrary,
if I have a spirit of constraint
I will not omit my meditation, even
though a sick person is very much in
need of my services.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>197.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Everything tends to the good of
those who love God. And, in truth,
since God can draw good from evil,
for whom will He do it, if not for
those who have given themselves
without reserve to Him? Yes,
everything tends to their profit, even
sin. David would never have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>so humble if he had not sinned; nor
would Magdalene’s love for her Saviour
have been what it was. Tell
me, then, what will He not do with
our afflictions and labours?</p>
<h3 class='c011'>198.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If, then, it ever happen that some
grief come upon you, assure your
soul that if she love God all things
will turn to her good. And though
you may not see the means by which
this good shall be effected, be all the
more convinced of it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>199.</h3>

<p class='c009'>It is a very good sign that the
enemy rages and beats at your door:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>it shows that he has not what he
wants. If he had he would cease to
cry out, but would quietly enter and
stay with you.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>200.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Courage! As long as we can say,
even coldly, God be praised, there is
no reason to fear. And do not tell me
that it seems to you that you say it
in a spiritless way, with no strength
or courage, but as if you had to do
violence to yourself to utter it. Oh,
this is the blessed violence which
taketh heaven!</p>
<h3 class='c011'>201.</h3>

<p class='c009'>As long as a temptation is displeasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to you there is nothing to
fear, for why does it displease you if
not because you do not wish it?</p>
<h3 class='c011'>202.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Moreover, these very importunate
temptations come from the malice of
the devil, but the trouble and suffering
they cause us come from the
mercy of God. He draws from the
malice of his enemy the holy tribulation
by which He refines the gold
He desires to place in his treasury.
Despise the temptations and embrace
the tribulations.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>203.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must endure our own want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>perfection, if we would attain perfection.
I say that we must endure
it patiently, but we must not love or
caress it. It is by the endurance of
this suffering that humility is nourished.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>204.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Those who aspire to pure love of
God have not so much need of patience
with others as with themselves.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>205.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must confess the truth: we
are poor creatures, capable of very
little that is good; but God, who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>infinitely good, is content with our
poor labours, and finds acceptable the
preparation of our heart.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>206.</h3>

<p class='c009'>But what means this preparation
of our heart according to the expression
of Holy Writ: “God is
greater than our heart, and our heart
is greater than the world?” When
our heart, in the solitude of meditation,
prepares the service which it
must render God, it effects marvels.
All this preparation, nevertheless, is
in no way proportioned to the grandeur
of God, and ordinarily it exceeds
our strength, and becomes too
great to be carried out in our exterior
actions.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>207.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Our minds prepare for God a
mortified flesh free from the rebellion
of the senses, prayer free from
distraction, a loving heart free from
all bitterness, a humility free from
all taint of vanity. All this is very
good, an excellent preparation; but
who carries it out? Alas! when we
come to the practise of it, we fall
short. Must we on this account be
disquieted, troubled, or afflicted?
No, certainly not. Must we apply
ourselves to exciting a multitude of
desires to stimulate ourselves to attain
this perfection? By no means.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>208.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I do not say that we must not tend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to perfection; but we must not desire
to attain it in a day, that is in
a day of this mortal life, for such a
desire would only uselessly disquiet
us.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>209.</h3>

<p class='c009'>It is not possible, I assure you, to
be completely rid of self while we
are on earth. We must always carry
self with us, until God carries us to
heaven; and while we carry self, we
carry a burden of very little value.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>210.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Solomon tells us that a servant
who suddenly becomes mistress is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>very insolent creature. Were a soul
to become all at once perfect mistress
of passions which it had long served,
I fear it could not but be vain and
proud.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>211.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If in our heart there be a single
thread of affection which is not for
God, we should instantly tear it out.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>212.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I cannot understand how you, a
daughter of God, long since abandoned
to the bosom of his mercy
and consecrated to his love, can
yield to such immoderate sadness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>You should console yourself, despising
all the mournful and melancholy
suggestions with which the devil
tries to weary you.</p>
<h3 id='Maxim213' class='c011'>213.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Do not examine yourself so carefully
to discover whether you are in
perfection or not; for, should we attain
the greatest perfection we should
neither know nor recognise it, but
always consider ourselves imperfect.
The end of our examen should never
be to discover whether we are imperfect,
for that we should never
doubt.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>214.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Therefore we should never be astonished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>at imperfection or let it
sadden us; for we cannot fail to
find ourselves imperfect in this life,
and there is no remedy for it save
humility, since by this virtue we
shall repair our faults and gradually
improve.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>215.</h3>

<p class='c009'>It is for the exercise of this virtue
that our imperfections are left to us,
since it is inexcusable not to seek to
correct them, and excusable not to
succeed perfectly; for it is not with
imperfections as it is with sins.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>216.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If you wish to do well, regard as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>temptation every suggestion concerning
change of place; for while
your mind is looking beyond where
it should be, it will never apply
itself to doing well the duty which
lies before it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>217.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must not desire all to begin
by perfection. It matters little how
one begins, provided he be resolved
to go on well, and end well.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>218.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I tell you that you will be faithful
if you are humble. But will you be
humble? Yes, if you wish it. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>I do wish it. Then you are humble.
But I feel that I am not. So much
the better; that helps to make you
more so.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>219.</h3>

<p class='c009'>You desire that it should always
be spring in your soul, but that cannot
be. We must endure vicissitudes
of weather interiorly as well as exteriorly.
It is only in heaven that
we shall find the perpetual beauty of
spring, the perpetual ripening of
summer, the perpetual fruition of
autumn. There we shall have no
winter; but here winter is required
for the exercise of abnegation, and
a thousand little virtues which are

are only meant to gratify the eyes of

We must not be so curious as to wish
to know the cause of the diversity of

patiently enduring aversions, repugnances,

<p class='c009'>I have gotten the habit of recommending
all who address themselves

the miseries of this world, if the divine
good pleasure be equally in the
miseries as in paradise. Labour is
paradise, if the divine will be found
in it, and paradise labour, if the
divine will be not in it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>360.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The divine good pleasure is the
sovereign object of the detached
soul; wherever it sees it, it runs in
the odour of its perfumes, unceasingly
seeks the places where it most
abounds, regardless of all other
things.</p>
<div>

  <h3 class='c011'>361.</h3>

<p class='c009'>In the monastery of the devout life
each one considers himself a novice,
and a lifetime is devoted to a probation
according to the rule of the
order; it is not the solemnity of the
vows but their fulfilment which
makes novices professed.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>362.</h3>

<p class='c009'>He who ardently loves God does
not turn back his gaze upon himself
to discover what he is doing, but keeps
his heart occupied with God, the object
of his love. A heavenly chorister
takes so much delight in pleasing
God, that he desires no pleasure from
the melody of his voice, save as it is
pleasing to his Sovereign.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>363.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is nothing so sad as to serve
a master who knows nothing of our
devotion, or who, if he knows it,
gives no sign of being satisfied with
it; and it must be a strong love
which sustains itself alone, unsupported
by any pleasure or aspiration.
Thus does it happen in the exercises
of sacred love; like deaf choristers
we do not hear our own voice, on the
contrary, we are oppressed by a
thousand fears, and by the uproar
which the devil makes about our
heart, suggesting that we are not
pleasing to our Master, that our love
is useless, yea, even false and vain.
Oh, my dear Theotime! it is then we
must manifest an invincible fidelity
to our Saviour, serving Him purely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>for love of his will, not only without
pleasure, but in the midst of this
deluge of sadness, terrors, alarms, and
temptations.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>364.</h3>

<p class='c009'>No, Lord, I wish for no event; for
I leave Thee to will it for me as
Thou pleasest; but instead of wishing
for events I bless Thee for those
Thou has ordained. Father, I am
thine. I know not what I should
wish; it is for Thee to will and do
for me all that shall seem to Thee
good. “My Father truly loves me,
and I am wholly his.”</p>
<h3 class='c011'>365.</h3>

<p class='c009'>O Jesus! be my sweetness and my
honey; sweeten my heart by the
sweetness of thine.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>366.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To whom is He not good, this
Sovereign Love of hearts? Those
who taste of his sweetness can never
be sated therewith, and those who
approach His heart cannot contain
their own with praising and blessing
Him for ever. Continue to unite
yourself more and more to this dear
Saviour. Bury your heart in the
charity of his, and let us say with all
our heart: “May I die and Jesus
live; this shall be a happy death if
it take place in this life.” May you
be blessed with the benediction
which the Divine Goodness has prepared
for hearts which abandon
themselves a prey to his sacred and
holy love.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>367.</h3>

<p class='c009'>You must bow your head and bear
yourself contrary to your habits or
inclinations. Live humbly before
God, amiably with your neighbour,
and sweetly with yourself.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>368.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Cast your thoughts earnestly upon
the shoulders of the Saviour, and He
will support and strengthen you.
When He calls you to a kind of service
which is contrary to your taste,
your courage should not be less, but
rather more than if your taste concurred
with his pleasure, for where
there is least of self the work goes
best. Do not permit your mind to
consider itself, its powers, its inclinations.
You must keep your eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>fixed upon the good pleasure of
God, and upon Providence.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>369.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must not amuse ourselves with
discoursing when we should run, nor
with chatting about difficulties when
we should conquer them. Say courageously:
“I will do much; not I,
but the grace of God which is within
me.”</p>
<h3 class='c011'>370.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Hold the cross of our Lord upon
your breast, and as long as you firmly
clasp it in your arms, the enemy will
be at your feet.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>371.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Ah! how I would like to see you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>always transfigured in our Lord!
Oh! how beautiful is his face, how
sweet his eyes in their wonderful
gentleness, and how good it is to be
with Him on the mount of glory!
It is there we should lodge our affections,
and not on this earth, where
there is nothing but empty beauty
and false vanity.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>372.</h3>

<p class='c009'>May God give you strength to
break the ties which prevent you
from following the heavenly attractions
of your heart! Ah! it is sad
to see a little bee in the treacherous
coils of a spider, but if a favourable
wind of grace break these wretched
fetters, these unfortunate meshes,
why does not this dear bee hasten to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>disentangle itself and proceed to the
making of its sweet honey.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>373.</h3>

<p class='c009'>The sting of honey-bees is much
more dangerous than that of other
bees, and so the machinations of
friends against us are exceedingly
hard to bear; but we must endure
them, bear with them, and finally
love them as dear contradictions.
We must absolutely, invariably, and
inviolably desire only God. But the
means of serving Him should be the
object of a very feeble desire on our
part, so that if one means be taken
from us we shall not be greatly affected
thereby. Our desire for everything
which is not God should be very
weak and indifferent.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>
  <h3 id='Maxim374' class='c011'>374.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When we are ill in body we must
exact of our minds only acts of submission
and acceptance of labour, and
acts uniting our will with the good
pleasure of God, which acts are
formed in the superior part of the
soul. As to exterior actions, we must
perform them as best we can, even
though it be languidly, heavily, and
against our inclinations; and to make
them acceptable to Divine Love,
we must acknowledge, accept, and
cherish the holy abjection of our
state. In this way you will change
the lead of your languor into gold,
and that, too, finer gold than your
heart could offer in its brightest and
happiest moments.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>375.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It seems to me that I see your
heart before me like a dial placed in
the sun, which never moves, while
its needle and balance are continually
in motion, ever turning towards the
beautiful planet; for your heart in
like manner remains motionless,
while your will is continually turning
by means of its good desires towards
God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>376.</h3>

<p class='c009'>How is your poor heart? Is it
always valiant and vigilant against
attacks of sadness? In God’s name,
do not torment it, even though it
wander a little; reprove it gently,
and bring it back to the path. You
will see that this heart will become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>a true heart, according to the Heart
of God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>377.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Think of that great dereliction
which our Master endured, and see
how this dear Son, having asked consolation
of his good Father, and seeing
that He willed not to grant it,
thought of it no more, ceased to seek
it, but, as if He had never desired it,
valiantly and courageously set about
the work of our redemption. After you
shall have prayed to your Heavenly
Father for consolation, if it does
not please Him to give it you, cease
to think of it, but renew your courage
to work out your salvation on the
cross, as if you were never to descend
therefrom.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>378.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>O my God! how beautiful, how
lovely is this cross! We make every
effort to obtain the wood, and we
exalt it on the Mount of Calvary.
Alas! happy are those who love it
and bear it. It will be exalted in
heaven, when our Lord shall come
to judge the living and the dead, to
teach us that heaven is the mansion
of crucified souls.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>379.</h3>

<p class='c009'>I love independent, vigorous, and
sensible souls; for this great sensibility
confuses and disquiets the heart,
and distracts it from the prayer of
loving attention to God, prevents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>complete resignation, and impedes
the perfect destruction of self-love. I
am the most affectionate person in
the world; and it seems to me that
I love nothing but God, and all souls
for God.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>380.</h3>

<p class='c009'>When a soul aspires to be the
spouse of Jesus Christ, it must cast
off the old man and clothe itself in
the new, by giving up sin, and then
cutting off from its life all the superfluities
which could divert it from
divine love.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>381.</h3>

<p class='c009'>As the exercise of purity of heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>ends only with life, let us not be
troubled at sight of our imperfections.
Our perfection consists in combating
them, and we cannot combat or vanquish
them without feeling and
knowing them.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>382.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Our Lord is the mysterious tree of
desire of which the holy spouse of
the canticle speaks. It is to his feet,
then, that we must go to breathe a
sweeter air, howsoever little the
heart may be oppressed by the atmosphere
of the world.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>383.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We desire to build a great edifice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>that is, to erect God’s dwelling within
us; therefore let us consider whether
we have sufficient courage to ruin
ourselves, or to let God raze us to the
ground that He may rebuild us into
a living temple of his Majesty.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>384.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Our sole pretentions should be to
be united to God, as our Lord was
united to his Father when He died
on the cross.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>385.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Desire nothing, ask nothing, refuse
nothing; this practice contains all
perfection.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>386.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>There is a certain simplicity of
heart which contains the perfection
of all perfections; and it is this simplicity
which makes our soul consider
God alone, and keep its forces
wholly collected within itself, in
order to devote itself with all possible
fidelity to the observance of his
laws, with no wish or desire for anything
else.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>387.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Recall yourself sometimes to the
interior solitude of your heart, and
there, removed from all creatures,
treat of the affairs of your salvation
and your perfection with God, as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>friend would speak heart to heart
with another.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>388.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We retire into God because we
aspire to Him, and we aspire to Him
that we may retire into Him. Thus
the retirement of the heart and the
aspiration towards God are one the
effect of the other.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>389.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Our will can never die, but it
sometimes passes beyond the limits
of its ordinary life to live wholly in
the divine will. This is accomplished
when it will not and cannot any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>longer will anything, but abandons
itself without reserve to the good
pleasure of Providence: it no longer
lives, but the will of God lives in it.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>390.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Let us be earnestly attentive to
blessing God for all that He shall
do, saying: “The Lord gave and the
Lord hath taken away; blessed be
the name of the Lord.” No, Lord,
I desire nothing; for I leave Thee to
will for me wholly as Thou pleasest;
instead of wishing for anything, I
bless Thee for what Thou shalt decree.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>391.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Hast thou fallen into the net of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>adversity? Look not at thy misfortunes,
or the snares into which
thou art taken, but turn to God and
leave all to Him. He will care for
thee.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>392.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We should peacefully abide in our
misery and abjection, in the midst of
our imperfections and weakness until
it shall please God to raise us to the
practice of great virtues.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>393.</h3>

<p class='c009'>We must live in this world as if
our mind were in heaven and our
body in the tomb.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>394.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Choose the best virtues and not
those which are most esteemed; the
most excellent, and not the most apparent;
the most solid, and not the
most fanciful.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>395.</h3>

<p class='c009'>If anger or pride attack me, I must
do all in my power to incline my
heart to humility and meekness, devoting
to that end my spiritual exercises,
the sacraments and the other
virtues.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>396.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Do not limit your patience to certain
trials, but extend it universally
to all that God shall send you, or
permit to reach you through any
source.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>397.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A truly patient man bears, with
the same evenness of temper, ignominious
trials and those which are
honourable. As the sting of bees is
more painful than that of flies, so
the contradictions we experience at
the hands of good people are more
trying than those which come from
the wicked.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>398.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Complain as little as possible of
injuries, for it rarely happens that
one complains without sin, since our
self-love exaggerates in our eyes and
hearts the wrongs we have received.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>399.</h3>

<p class='c009'>You wish absolutely to form Jesus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Christ in you, in your heart, in your
works, by a sincere love of his doctrine
and a perfect imitation of his
life; rest assured it will cost you
many pangs; but they will pass
away, and the presence of Jesus,
who shall live in you, will fill your
soul with an ineffable joy which can
never be taken from you.</p>
<h3 class='c011'>400.</h3>

<p class='c009'>Think frequently of Jesus crucified;
consider Him covered with
wounds, filled with sadness, despoiled
of everything, loaded with
maledictions. Then you will acknowledge
that your sufferings can
in no way compare with his, and that
never shall you endure anything in
the least degree approaching what
He suffered for you.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>
  <h3 class='c011'>401.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>God’s great desire is that we should
be perfect, to unite ourselves with
Him by the perfect imitation of his
sanctity. “Be you therefore perfect,
as your Heavenly Father is perfect.”</p>
